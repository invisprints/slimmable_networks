Illustration of slimmable neural networks. The same model can run at different widths (number of active channels), permitting instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.


## Run

0. Requirements:
    * Setup according to [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) based on commit [86e25e](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/86e25e41aea1c2170c0b242e486b1d4685134f31).
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ./compile.sh
    pip install .
   ```
1. Testing:
    * Download our [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ueqa1BYhDQ0ANm1j3NwrSTgNfKkPmrdJ) of mask-rcnn and faster-rcnn.
    * Choose the width multiplier to evaluate, where width ratio can be selected from {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}.
    ```
    python tools/test.py configs/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py {pretrained_model_file.pt} --eval bbox --width_mult {width_ratio}
    ```
2. Training:
    ```
    python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 tools/train.py configs/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py --launcher pytorch
    ```
3. Still have questions?
    * If you still have questions, please search closed issues first. If the problem is not solved, please open a new.


## Technical Details

Implementing slimmable networks for detection is straightforward as shown in this single commit [8bc1dd8](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/slimmable_networks/commit/8bc1dd80490f8b8e3fd8ffe249c4fbf6dc4b9910).
